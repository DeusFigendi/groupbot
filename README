These are - more or less - two projects:
1. all the .js files are javascript files written for phantomjs to do
    several stuff with Diaspora. It can read the stream or aspects or
        hashtags or mentions, it can post postings or comment, it can
                    read the list of aspects and the users in it etc.
    To use these you'd need phantomjs http://phantomjs.org/ to see
        what the modules do start 'em with phantomjs and use the ?
                                           parameter. For example:
    ./phantomjs post_comment.js ?
    It should be possible to build many diffrent diaspora-clients
     based on this phantomjs modules. Yea it's not fast, yes it's
         not complete or perfect. But it's usable and improvable.
         
2. the groupbot.tcl is a TCL script that provides a group
    functionality for diaspora. It works pretty much like
      a mailinglists mail deliverer. So it takes postings
          from users and "delivers" (reposts) them to all
            other members of a group. Users can subsribe,
             unsubscribe, manage and found groups, and of
                      corse they can send posts to those.
    Groupbot.tcl uses the js-files to comunicate with diaspora so
    as long as the output of these files keep similar to now they
             can be improved, replaced or - of corse - be forked.
             
## REQUIREMENTS:

What you'll need to setup a groupbot:

* A diaspora account the bot uses
* phantomjs (http://phantomjs.org/)
* the files in this repository
* a TCL interpreter

## PREPARATION AND START:

* Register the diaspora-account for the bot manually (the script doesn't do this stuff automaticly)
* delete all aspects of the acount (using your browser!)
* create an aspect "users"
* create an aspect "admins" and add your own diaspora-account (not used yet)
* got to base-url/user/edit (Username â†’ Settings) in your Browser
* uncheck "Show Community Spotlight in Stream?" and save
* check "Automatically follow back if someone follows you", choose "users" and save
* set up a userprofile
* set up my_settings in generic_functions.js and delete or comment the injection of override_logindata.js or setup my_settings in override_logindata.js
* set up phantombin in groupbot.tcl. In my case I just threw the js and tcl files into ~/phantomjs/bin/ and used to use "./phantomjs" but if you place your phantomjs otherwheres e.g. in /opt/phantomjs/ you'd have to setup "/opt/phantomjs/bin/phantomjs"
* you CAN also setup the groupprefix and the checkfrequency in groupbot.tcl it's explained there.
* start the bot using:
  tclsh groupbot.tcl
  or (as I do)
  /opt/ActiveTcl-8.5/bin/tclsh8.5 groupbot.tcl
  or
  /opt/ActiveTcl-8.5/bin/tclsh8.5 /home/username/diasporabots/groupbot/groupbot.tcl
  or somethin like that.
* add the bot to one of your aspects (or better create a bot-aspect)
* write a posting mentioning the bot (@-command) with your diaspora-account AND use the word "help" in the first line.
* have fun
